    <h1>Block & Inline</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>There are two display values: block and inline</li>
        <li>A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available</li>
        <li>An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary</li>
        <li>The <b>div</b> element is a block-level and is often used as a container for other HTML elements</li>
        <li>The <b>span</b> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document</li>
    </ul>
